# accept a starting value, and the function, , to optimize
# implement the iterative algorithm
# implement the stopping criterion (feel free to keep this simple)
# calculate the first and second derivatives using a basic finite difference approach to estimating the derivative based on the definition of a derivative as a limit
# note that the second derivative can be seen as calling the first derivative twiceâ€¦
